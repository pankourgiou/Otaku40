In the above program, we define a function called OR that takes two input values (x and y) and returns the result of the OR gate operation. It uses the ifelse function to perform the logical check and returns 1 if both x and y are equal to 1; otherwise, it returns 0.
We then define two vectors, x and y, which represent the input values for the AND gate. Using the mapply function, we apply the OR function to each corresponding pair of elements from x and y vectors, which performs the OR operation on them.
Finally, we display the result using the print function.
You can modify this code to implement other logic gates such as OR, NOT, etc., using similar functional programming principles.
